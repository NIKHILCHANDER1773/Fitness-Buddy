        <p class="animated-text">
          Staying consistent is the most important principle when it comes to achieving fitness goals. While motivation gets you started, it's consistency that keeps you going. Building routines, sticking to your workout plan, and making healthy food choices every day are what lead to long-term progress.
        </p>

        <p class="animated-text">
          Whether your goal is to lose weight, build muscle, or improve overall wellness, creating habits you can stick to is crucial. Remember, it's not about being perfect; it's about being persistent. Progress is built through daily effort.
        </p>
